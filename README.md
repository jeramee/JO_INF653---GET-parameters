## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple web processor using PHP. It accepts user input through forms, processes the data, and displays personalized messages based on the provided parameters.

## Files

- **index.php:** The main PHP file containing the web processor code.
- **process_form.php:** It processes the form parameters from the user.
- **view/form_elements.php:** The file containing the HTML form elements to be included in both GET and POST forms.
- **css/main.css:** The stylesheet for basic styling.

## Instructions

1. Open `index.php` to view the main web processor.
2. Test the functionality by submitting forms with various parameters directly in the browser's address bar.
3. The project uses PHP functions to sanitize input, prevent XSS attacks, and handle both GET and POST methods.

## Notes

- The project includes a reset button to clear the form data.
- Ensure proper server configuration to execute PHP scripts.
